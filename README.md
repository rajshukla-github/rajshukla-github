### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, RAJ SHUKLA
#### MERN and Android Developer

I'm an enthusiastic "Web and App Developer" with almost 3 years of experience. I've collaborated with others on numerous projects/hackathons and completed personal projects in MERN stack.
Coequally, I'm involved in "Competitive Coding" with regularly participation in weekly and monthly competitions.

I believe in my personal philosophy that "If data is the FUEL, then we are the ENGINE".                   [<img src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@3.0.1/icons/linkedin.svg' alt='linkedin' height='40'>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajshukla00/)
