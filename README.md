### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, RAJ SHUKLA
#### MERN Stack and Android Developer

I'm an enthusiastic "Web and App Developer" with almost 3 years of experience. I've collaborated with others on numerous projects/hackathons and completed personal projects in MERN stack.
Coequally, I'm involved in "Competitive Coding" with regularly participation in weekly and monthly competitions & contests.

I believe in my personal philosophy that ### "If data is the FUEL, then we are the ENGINE".
